## PostgreSQL

This folder contains projects where I used PostgreSQL for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### Data Cleaning
I performed various data cleaning tasks such as:
- Converting text into appropriate data types  
- Standardizing spacing and formatting  
- Cleaning up `UNKNOWN` or `ERROR` values  
- Populating missing values when possible  
- Leaving some null values as-is to avoid introducing inaccuracies

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this part, I answered specific questions to generate insights and reports. These guiding questions helped me better understand the dataset and the overall goals of each project.
